This is a repository of jQuery plugins that we've created at Adaptavist.com.
They are too small to warrant their own repositories, so they will remain
here unless they grow.

Plugins:

jquery.conflict.js

	For use in a multiple jQuery environment.
	Ensures that scripts are loaded with the current jQuery in the global scope.


jquery.defer.js

	Defer any callback function, most useful for events.
	See: http://www.adaptavist.com/display/free/jQuery+Defer


jquery.overlay.js

	Deep prototypal inheritance, useful for configurations and JSON modifications.
